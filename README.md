Once authorized, the user has access to the live feed from the camera with
various options of control such as rotation of the camera and capturing images
and videos (*In progress*).

## Hardware Requirements

The electrical schematic for the product is provided below.

![Electrical Schematic](surveillance/static/images/Schematic_Surveillance-Systems-V1_2024-06-01.png)

This application uses the following hardware:

1. Raspberry Pi 5 with 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS Debian Distro (*Released: 2024-03-15*).
2. Freenove 8MP camera module provided with their [instructions and quickstart guides](https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_Camera_Module_for_Raspberry_Pi). 
3. Standard servo motor (3-pin) PiGPIO compatible.
4. [Geeekpi Mini Tower Kit](https://www.amazon.ca/GeeekPi-Raspberry-Cooler-Module-Expansion/dp/B0CQYTN94R) for Raspberry Pi 5.

## Installations

Update and upgrade the system

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

It is recommended to start a python virtual environment.

This command includes already installed libraries such as picamera2.
```shell 
python -m venv --system-site-packages <environment path>
```

*Note change <> to the desired location to store the environment.*

Install the application's dependency requirements.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The following shell commands are used to run the camera application.

```shell
python -m surveillance -c <path to the config.json>
```

For non-root users `--libcamera-hello` does not detect dma_heap. Other solutions
online such as editing a specific file may not work, so this command is an alternative.

```shell
sudo -E python -m surveillance -c <path to the config.json>
```

*Note: A file called config.json is required which is formatted as follows:*

```json
{
    "sender_email": "email to use to send notifications",  
    "sender_password": "sender email password (generated by google).",
    "receivers": ["email recipients"],
    "secret_key": "secret key",
    "location": "Location of the camera",
    "users": {
        "username": "password"
    }
}
```

If file changes are required, add permission to the file to allow changes to be saved.
```shell
sudo chmod a+rwx <filepath>
```

## Application Public Access

* remote.it

This is one of many solutions for accessing the connection to the Raspberry Pi 
including the locally deployed Flask server from anywhere with internet access
provided by the services in [remote.it](https://www.remote.it/download). 

* Port Forwarding
